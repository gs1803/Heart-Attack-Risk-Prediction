# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction
This Project uses Transfer learning to classify Heart Attack Risk. Ensemble methods were used to "learn" more
information about the dataset, and a Feedforward Neural Network was implemented from scratch to obtain the final
results. The FNN Implemented various activation functions, weight initialization methods, to allow for maximum
customizability.

Python Version: 3.11.3
Packages Used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, 
itertools, scikit-plot, ipykernel, jupyter

Random states were used to allow for reproducible results
